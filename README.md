# Deep learning architecture optimization

Metaheuristic procedures for recurrent neural network (RNN) optimization.


## Index

This respository contains several deliverables associated to the main topic (RNN optimization). The main structure is as follows:

* **architecture**: metaheuristic based RNN architecture optimization and backpropagation training.
* **data**: datasets used in publications.
* **etc**: analysis, useful scripts, and other stuff.
* **publications**: stand alone deliverables related to scientific publications. Please refer to [Publications](#publications).
* **weight**: metaheuristic based RNN architecture and weights optimization.



## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

Each deliverable (sub project) contains a **requirements.txt** file listing the Python packages needed to tun the code.

### Installing

Clone the repository on your local machine, install the dependencies (you may want to use a virtual environment), and have fun!
