# DLOPT: Deep Learning Optimization

Python library for artificial neural network (NN) optimization.


## Index

This respository contains several deliverables associated to the main topic (NN optimization). The main structure is as follows:

* **data**: datasets used in publications.
* **dlopt**: main library
* **etc**: analysis, useful scripts, and other stuff.
* **examples**: a quick guide on using DLOPT
* **publications**: stand alone deliverables related to scientific publications. Please refer to [Publications](#publications).


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

The main folder contains a **requirements.txt** file listing the Python packages needed to tun the code.

### Installing

Clone the repository on your local machine, install the dependencies (you may want to use a virtual environment), and have fun!

### Building

To build a binary application you could use **pyinstaller**. Remember to add the path to required libraries and any hidden import, for example:

```
pyinstaller optimizer.py -F --path ../env/lib/python3.5/ --hidden-import algorithms
```
